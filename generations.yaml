  - name: "First Generation (Z50)"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2007
    description: "The original Nissan Murano was introduced as a mid-size crossover featuring distinctive styling that departed from traditional boxy SUV designs of the era. The exterior showcased a sleek, aerodynamic profile with a distinctive grille, wraparound headlights, and seamlessly integrated rear liftgate. Built on Nissan's FF-L platform shared with the Altima and Maxima, it offered car-like handling with SUV versatility. Powered by a 3.5L VQ35DE V6 engine producing 245 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT)—one of the first applications of a CVT in a V6-powered vehicle. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations using an intuitive on-demand system. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with a floating center console, modern design elements, and premium materials unusual for a mainstream brand at the time. Available features included a navigation system, Bose audio, leather seating, and a power sunroof. The first-generation Murano helped establish the premium mid-size crossover segment, offering more sophisticated styling and driving dynamics than traditional SUVs while maintaining practical utility. It significantly influenced crossover design trends with its emphasis on style alongside functionality."

  - name: "Second Generation (Z51)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The second-generation Murano evolved the distinctive styling of its predecessor with a more sculpted exterior featuring an aggressive front fascia, pronounced wheel arches, and complex surface detailing. Continuing on a revised version of the FF-L platform, it grew slightly in all dimensions. Powered by an updated 3.5L V6 now producing 260-265 horsepower (depending on model year), again paired with an improved continuously variable transmission (CVT), available in front-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations. The interior offered increased refinement with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and enhanced technology including an available hard-drive based navigation system, rearview camera, and dual-panel moonroof. A novel addition was the Murano CrossCabriolet introduced in 2011—a two-door convertible variant with a power-folding soft top that was the first crossover convertible from a mainstream manufacturer, though its unconventional design achieved limited commercial success. The Murano LE trim offered near-luxury appointments including wood trim, premium leather, and additional convenience features. This generation maintained the model's position as a style-focused alternative to more conventional crossovers, emphasizing refinement and distinctive design over maximum utility or off-road capability."

    end_year: null
    description: "The third-generation Murano features bold, futuristic styling based on Nissan's 'V-Motion' design language with a prominent V-shaped grille, boomerang-shaped lighting elements, floating roof design achieved through blacked-out D-pillars, and complex sculpted body sides. Built on the evolved D platform shared with other Nissan and Infiniti products, it prioritizes comfort and refinement. Powered by a 3.5L V6 engine producing 260 horsepower, paired with a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and available with front-wheel or intuitive all-wheel drive. The interior represents a significant advancement with premium materials including available semi-aniline leather, 'Zero Gravity' seats designed to reduce fatigue, ambient lighting, and a sweeping, layered dashboard design. Technology features include an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system (later upgraded to include Apple CarPlay and Android Auto), available Bose premium audio, 360-degree Around View Monitor, and an expanding suite of driver assistance features eventually encompassing Nissan Safety Shield 360 and ProPILOT Assist semi-autonomous driving capability. A significant refresh in 2019 brought additional safety features, updated technology, and subtle styling refinements. Throughout its production, the third-generation Murano has maintained its position as Nissan's premium five-passenger crossover, emphasizing sophisticated design, comfort, and technology over sportiness or off-road capability."
